# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, it's recommended to first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email,
or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. However, if the change is simple enough,
this process may be skipped and a PR may be opened directly.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure that your code is tested and follows the project's coding style.
2. Ensure that your Pull Request follows the template defined in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least another developer, or if you do not have
   permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

## Issuing new releases

This project uses [Semver](https://semver.org/) together with Git tags in the "master" branch. Each time a tag is
created in the "master" branch a new release will be issued, with the associated Docker images pushed to Docker Hub.
You can see in detail how the release management is done in README.
